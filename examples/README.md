# Rockit Cloud provider examples

This directory contains a set of examples of using various Rockit Cloud services with Terraform.
The examples have their own README containing more details on what the example does.

The examples take credentials and API endpoints from a `c2rc.sh` file.
Get the file for your project and place it in the example's directory before running the example.
The cross-account examples need one file per account, see their README for details.

To run any example, clone the repository and run `terraform apply` within the example's own directory.

For example:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/C2Devel/terraform-provider-rockitcloud
$ cd terraform-provider-rockitcloud/examples/count
$ cp /path/to/c2rc.sh .
$ terraform apply
...
```
