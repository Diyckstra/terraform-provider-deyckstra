# ELB Example

The ELB (Elastic Load Balancing) example launches the nginx web server on the target instance and creates an ELB with necessary network resources.

This example assumes that an SSH key pair was created in the cloud console.

The example takes credentials from a `c2rc.sh` file.
Get the file for your project and place it in this directory before running the example.

Running the example:

```shell
$ terraform init
$ terraform apply -var="key_name=your-key-name"
```

In a few minutes, you can reach the nginx welcome page at the ELB DNS name.

Destroying the example:

```
$ terraform destroy -var="key_name=your-key-name"
```

Instead of using `-var`, you can copy `terraform.template.tfvars` to `terraform.tfvars` and use it to specify variable values.
