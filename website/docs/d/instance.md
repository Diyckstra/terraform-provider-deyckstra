# Data Source: aws_instance

Provides information about an EC2 instance.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "aws_instance" "selected" {
  instance_id = "i-12345678"

  filter {
    name   = "image-id"
    values = ["cmi-12345678"]
  }

  instance_tags = {
    type = "test"
  }

  filter {
    name   = "tag:Name"
    values = ["example"]
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `filter` – (Optional) One or more name/value pairs to use as filters.
    * _Valid values_: See names and values in [EC2 API documentation][describe-instances].
* `get_user_data` – (Optional) Retrieve Base64 encoded user data contents into the `user_data_base64` attribute.
  A SHA-1 hash of the user data contents will always be present in the `user_data` attribute.
    * _Default value_: `false`
* `instance_id` – (Optional) Specify the exact instance ID with which to populate the data source.
* `instance_tags` – (Optional) Map of tags, each pair of which must exactly match a pair on the desired instance.

~> **Note** At least one of the arguments `filter`, `instance_tags`, or `instance_id` must be specified.

~> **Note** If anything other than a single match is returned by the search,
Terraform will fail. Ensure that your search is specific enough to return
a single instance ID only.

## Attributes Reference

### Supported attributes

The following attributes are exported:

* `affinity` – The affinity setting for an instance on a dedicated host.
* `ami` – The ID of the image used to launch the instance.
* `arn` – The ARN of the instance.
* `associate_public_ip_address` – Whether the instance is associated with a public IP address or not.
* `availability_zone` – The availability zone of the instance.
* `ebs_block_device` – The EBS block device mappings of the instance.
  The structure of this block is [described below](#ebs_block_device)
* `ephemeral_block_device` – The ephemeral block device mappings of the instance.
  The structure of this block is [described below](#ephemeral_block_device)
* `host_id` – The ID of the dedicated host that the instance will be assigned to.
* `id` – The ID of the instance.
* `instance_state` – The state of the instance.
    * _Valid values_: `pending`, `running`, `shutting-down`, `terminated`, `stopping`, `stopped`
* `instance_type` – The type of the instance.
* `key_name` – The key name of the instance.
* `monitoring` – Whether detailed monitoring is enabled or disabled for the instance.
* `network_interface_id` – The ID of the network interface that was created with the instance.
* `placement_group` – The placement group of the instance.
* `private_dns` – The private DNS name assigned to the instance.
    * _Constraints_: For EC2-VPC, this is only available if you've enabled DNS hostnames for your VPC.
* `private_ip` – The private IP address assigned to the instance
* `secondary_private_ips` – The secondary private IPv4 addresses assigned to the instance's primary network interface in a VPC.
* `public_dns` – The public DNS name assigned to the instance. For EC2-VPC, this is only available if you've enabled DNS hostnames for your VPC.
* `public_ip` – The public IP address assigned to the instance, if applicable.
    * _Constraints_: If you are using an [`aws_eip`](../resources/eip.md) with your instance, you should refer to the EIP's address directly and not use `public_ip`, as this field will change after the EIP is attached
* `root_block_device` – The root block device mappings of the instance
  The structure of this block is [described below](#root_block_device)
* `security_groups` – The associated security groups.
* `source_dest_check` – Whether the network interface performs source/destination checking.
* `subnet_id` – The ID of the VPC subnet.
* `user_data` – SHA-1 hash of user data supplied to the instance.
* `user_data_base64` – Base64 encoded contents of user data supplied to the instance. Valid UTF-8 contents can be decoded with the [`base64decode` function][base64decode-function].
    * _Constraints_: This attribute is only exported if `get_user_data` is true
* `tags` – Map of tags assigned to the instance.
* `tenancy` – The placement type.
* `vpc_security_group_ids` – The associated security groups in a non-default VPC.

#### ebs_block_device

The `ebs_block_device` block has the following structure:

* `delete_on_termination` – If the EBS volume will be deleted on termination.
* `device_name` – The physical name of the device.
* `iops` – `0` If the EBS volume is not a provisioned IOPS image, otherwise the supported IOPS count.
* `snapshot_id` – The ID of the snapshot.
* `volume_size` – The size of the volume, in GiB.
* `volume_type` – The volume type.

#### ephemeral_block_device

The `ephemeral_block_device` block has the following structure:

* `device_name` – The physical name of the device.
* `no_device` – Whether the specified device included in the device mapping was suppressed or not.
* `virtual_name` – The virtual device name.

#### root_block_device

The `root_block_device` block has the following structure:

* `device_name` – The physical name of the device.
* `delete_on_termination` – If the root block device will be deleted on termination.
* `iops` – `0` If the volume is not a provisioned IOPS image, otherwise the supported IOPS count.
* `volume_size` – The size of the volume, in GiB.
* `volume_type` – The type of the volume.
